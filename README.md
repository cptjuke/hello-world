👋😃 Hi, I'm Juan Carlos, a fresh new IT graduate who just started to see what he wants to do for a living.

🌨 I’m interested in Infraestructure as a whole, IaC and virtualization get the most of my attention, but the cloud and the whole functionality circle its also a really interesting topic for me.

🐳 I’m currently learning Terraform as a deploy system, Docker as my container engine and I plan on start soon on Jenkins too make it all dance together, I'm also deep in Azure and trying to start AWS and GCP.

 🏜 I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. But any project that needs a circle of life or a infraestructure that would allow me to practice and acquire more knowledge would be perfect.

📧 If you feel like you and me can be good partners in crime dont hesitate to reach me either in linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcarlosct/ or jcarlosct97@hotmail.com
